# Handwriting_Recognition_Project
Handwriting Recognition using Image Processing Techniques and Machine Learning

Overview
The Handwriting Recognition System is a sophisticated project developed as part of the Digital Image Processing course at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technical Education. The goal is to convert handwritten text into digital text using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques.

Features
Image Pre-processing: Converts images to an optimal format for analysis.
Character Segmentation: Isolates individual characters for further processing.
Machine Learning: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and interpret characters.
User Interface: A simple, intuitive GUI for uploading images and displaying results.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Tkinter
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies to set up the project on your local machine:

bash
Sao chép mã
git clone https://github.com/fwishy121/Handwriting_Recognition_Project.git
cd Handwriting_Recognition_Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the project, execute the following command:

bash
Sao chép mã
python main.py
This command starts the application, where you can upload an image of handwritten text and see the recognized text output.
