# Handwriting Recognition Project

## Overview
The Handwriting Recognition System is a sophisticated project developed as part of the Digital Image Processing course at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technical Education. The goal is to convert handwritten text into digital text using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **Image Pre-processing:** Converts images to an optimal format for analysis.
- **Character Segmentation:** Isolates individual characters for further processing.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and interpret characters.
- **User Interface:** A simple, intuitive GUI for uploading images and displaying results.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Tkinter
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies to set up the project on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fwishy121/Handwriting_Recognition_Project.git
